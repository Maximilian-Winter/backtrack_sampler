She long cherished her home, a cozy nest nestled upon the gentle slopes, but her heart would not permit itself trust to soar into those lofty realms without fear of the unfathomably great drops, and what dreadful consequences might arise in the vast unknown depths beyond her home – a thought so daunting it left even Thistles pale as moonlit shadows to her own reflection on a moonlit lake.\n",

The night was filled to its fullest, the starlings sang softly in anticipation; and with each passing step Thistles' fear grew, growing so that what the moon seemed like, now felt more and less a light, and she was left wondering what lay beyond that distant peak, what dangers might she discover as to be the true horror.\n",

            "The dragon, named Ember, lived in the heart of the Dragon's Spine mountains. They were known for their treacherous paths and steep cliffs that seemed to stretch up to the heavens. It was said that anyone who dared to venture into these mountains would meet a fiery end.\n",
            "But Ember was not like his fellow dragons. His scales glowed with a soft, ethereal light in the dark, and his wingspan was so great that he could barely get in the river's bend, which they affectionately called the River's Secret.\n",
            "As a child, Ember had been fascinated by the river below, watching from the safety of the riverbank as the water flowed gently downstream. But the thrill of its currents never wavered its attention; Ember loved the river but couldn't stand the risk of falling onto its rocky edge.\n",
            "As he grew older, Ember became increasingly withdrawn, avoiding any activity that required him to be at the river's bend. That was, until the day he met the wise old badger, Thistle.\n",
            "Thistle, sensing the dragon's insecurities, took Ember on a journey along the mountain trails. They climbed to higher elevations, but Ember still refused to budge closer to the bend. It was then that Thistle told Ember of the old tales of the mountains, where brave warriors had braved the treacherous paths and even stood tall enough to stare down the fierce beasts that roamed the valleys below.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thistle's words struck a chord within Ember. After years of fear, Ember finally made the decision to face his fears. He took one step towards the river, then another, his heart pounding in his chest. As he neared the bend, Ember's doubt was replaced by determination.\n",
            "On that day, Ember reached the river's bend. It was just as Thistle had described. The water flow was swift and turbulent, and the rocks looked sharper and more treacherous than he had ever imagined. But Ember stood his ground. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and let the river's gentle flow wash over his scales.\n",
            "As the water washed away his doubts and fears, Ember opened his eyes to reveal that the mountain itself seemed to be shining brighter. His scales glistened, reflecting a new light, and his wingspan grew wider, as if no longer bound by the fear that had held him back.\n",
            "From that day forward, Ember stood tall, defying his fears to stare out at the world beyond the mountain's spines. And whenever he caught a glimpse of the river, he smiled, knowing that sometimes the greatest heights are conquered with courage and determination. The dragon of the river's bend lived on the other side of fear, with a heart full of light and a spirit bold. by the river's bend.\n",
